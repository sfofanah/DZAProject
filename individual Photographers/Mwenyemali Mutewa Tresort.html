<p class="text-uppercase mt-md-3 text-left" style="font-size: 180%;"><strong>Biography</strong></p>
      <p> My name is Muenyemali Mutewa Tresort, a Congolese by nationality. Since I was little, photography was my passion. I remember I was still a student and my family did not accept my joining photography. But, I have persisted and even though I had no equipment, I did not give up my dream. When I finished my secondary studies, whereby I met a certain brother and he taught me photography. Due to violence and atrocity, I fled my country to Malawi. Upon my arrival in Dzaleka, I had nothing to do. My life was miserable. I started working with a certain brother who was already a photographer and had all the equipment. He also taught me how to edit pictures and video, which means I learned filmmaking. I was saving money, the little that I was getting from my work. When I saved what totaled 300,000 Malawi Kwacha, I bought my first camera to date. After getting my own camera, I started working hard to buy a laptop. When I got a laptop, I stopped working with the brother and started my own company. It’s now been 4 years since I’ve been working for myself. I haven’t yet a shop, so I still work at home. My life has improved little by little. I take care of my family. My photography skills have improved a lot, and I even teach people photography and filmmaking. What I can advise youths is that they should make time and avoid all sorts of distractions. I have an example of a neighbour who I met while he was deadly drunk. I told to come home, and I will teach him photography so that he could live a better life than what he was living. Now, I work with him, and he no longer drinks alcohol anymore like before. Now we are partners. As well, I’m asking to all people who have the heart to support people who have skills to help with the development of the Dzaleka Refugee Camp. </p>
