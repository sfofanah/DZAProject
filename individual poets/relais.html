		<strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br />
		<strong>Biography by Angela Bizera<br /></strong>
		<strong>Photo by Luanda Bauma Primo<br /></strong><br />

	  
		Relais W. Looko is a young man from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is 15 years old. He came to Malawi in 2013 and is currently a student<br /><br />
		
    	He is a poet who only likes to write and does not like performing. Poetry is a talent he has, and it makes him feel good even during his sad moments. He was surrounded by friends who were poets, which inspired him and he started to write as well. He started this journey while he was learning English at White Future Center where they were also taught poetry. It is here that he started writing and even recited his first poem. Poetry makes him express himself, all his feelings he has and is going through. Whether he is happy or sad, he expresses his emotions through writing.<br /><br />
		
		He wrote the poem “Orphan” based on a true story about himself. He decided to write and express how being an orphan affected him.<br /><br />
		
		His advice to readers of the book and website is that they should never give up and should continue to pursue their dreams. There are some who are orphans but that should not limit them to achieving anything and they should trust themselves.

    	ANGELA (Poem 1)<br /><br />
	  
    	I think I am truly in love with you<br />
	  
      	Everything that I see my love<br />
	  
  	 	I only find flashes of you<br /><br />
	  
		Your love give me a solace<br />
	  
	 	And that’s why you are called Angela<br />
	
		Origin from Angel<br />

		You are my Angel<br /><br />
	
		When you look at me<br />

		I feel a little shy<br />

		Each time I close my eyes<br />

		You are the first I see<br /><br />
	
		Each time I take a breath<br />
	
		It is for you my darling I breathe<br />

		My heart yearns for you each day<br />

		I love you<br />

		You are my Angel!<br /><br /><br />
	
		ORPHAN (Poem 2)<br /><br />
	
		It was many and many years ago<br />

		Where my parents waved the world<br />

		They were transported in the planet of loneliness<br /><br />

		They left me a name<br />
	
		I was called an orphan<br />
	
		Being treated like an orphan<br />

		Grouped in groups of orphan<br />

		And known as an orphan <br /><br />
	
		After death we were taken for granted by the man<br />

		Just hanging around like a chicken searching for food<br />

		No one calls me by my old familiar name<br /><br />
	
		I had pains fencing my lonely heart<br />

		Being an orphan is not my wish<br />

		My eyes runs heavy rains each day<br />
		
		I am a poor orphan<br />
