<p class="text-uppercase mt-md-3 text-left" style="font-size: 180%;"><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>My name is Vianney Bisimwa. I came to Malawi in 2014 from the Democratic Republic of Congo. I was a university student before I arrived in Dzaleka.  My life was very difficult in the camp, with nothing to do. Despites hardships, though, I did not give up. I decided to join a carpentry course for a year, even though I initially had no interest in becoming a carpenter. When I finished the course, I was very happy because I had learned something that I could use to improve my living conditions. I realized, though, that I had no equipment, so I started making bricks and sold them in order to get money. After a couple of months, I got enough money to buy equipment. As of now I can say that my life has improved. Through carpentry I have built a house, and I have married my beautiful wife. I have a big family that I can support, and that is the greatest achievement in my life. I earn 30000 Malawi Kwacha per month, and I have opened a workshop where I teach youths for free. I advise others to join carpentry because it has helped me so much and has become a source of income. I ask well-wishers who have the heart to help to support refugeesâ€™ work and ideas.
